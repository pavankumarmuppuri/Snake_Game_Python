<h1>Snake Game</h1>

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Turtle module in Python.

<h2>How to Play</h2>

Run the Python script main.py.<br>
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.<br>
Eat the red food (circles) to grow the snake and earn points.<br>
Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.<br>
The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.<br>
Your final score will be displayed at the end of the game.<br>

<h2>Controls</h2>

Up Arrow: Move the snake up.<br>
Down Arrow: Move the snake down.<br>
Left Arrow: Move the snake left.<br>
Right Arrow: Move the snake right.<br>

<h2>Customization</h2>
You can adjust the game speed by changing the DELAY variable in the script.<br>
Modify the window size, colors, or shapes of the snake and food objects to customize the game's appearance.<br>
Experiment with different rules or game mechanics to create your own variations of the Snake Game.<br>
